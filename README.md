# youtub3r!

Youtub3r scans your [Channels DVR Server](https://getchannels.com/dvr-serer/) and attempts to find the corresponding `info.json` files created by [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat) and applies the metadata and artwork to the videos in Channels.

It will only attempt this for videos in your library that are part of Video Groups with the label `youtube` or genre `YouTube` applied.

## Organization

[Channels](https://getchannels.com) expects videos to be grouped into folders. These are calld [Video Groups](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/local-content/#video-groups).

### Channels

You should have all your YouTube videos grouped into their own Video Group directories, with the root directory added as a Video Source in [Channels](https://getchannels.com).

For example, if your videos are organized like this:

    /YouTube Videos/Concerts
    /YouTube Videos/SNL Clips
    /YouTube Videos/Music Videos

Then you would add `/YouTube Videos` as a new Video Source in [Channels](https://getchannels.com).

### Pinchflat

Ensure `Download Metadata` is enabled in the Media Profile you are using with Pinchflat. This will create the `info.json` files that youtub3r needs to read the metadata.

[Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat) defaults to organizing videos for each Source into their own directory. But the default Media Profile puts each video into its own directory. We suggest against this. Instead, format the `output path template` to something like this:

    /{{ source_custom_name }}/{{ upload_yyyy_mm_dd }}-{{ title }}.{{ ext }}

This will result in a directory structure like this:

    /YouTube Videos/Source Name/2024_06_01-Video 1.mp4
    /YouTube Videos/Source Name/2024_06_01-Video 1.info.json
    /YouTube Videos/Source Name/2024_06_12-Video 2.mp4
    /YouTube Videos/Source Name/2024_06_12-Video 2.info.json

This is a required structure for youtub3r to work.

## Usage

### ENV VARS

| ENV VAR         | Description                     | Required | Default |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| SERVER_HOST     | host of Channels DVR Server     | Yes      |         |
| WAIT_IN_SECONDS | Number of seconds between scans | No       | 60      |

### Video Directory

Youtub3r needs access to your YouTube video files and their corresponding `info.json` files created by Pinchflat.

You must mount your video directory into the container at `/youtube_videos`.

This directory must be the root directory of your YouTube video groups. This is the same path you added as a Video Source in Channels.

### CLI

```bash
docker run \
--name youtub3r \
-e SERVER_HOST="192.168.1.2:8089"
-v /path/to/videos:/youtube_videos
jonmaddox/youtub3r
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  youtub34:
    image: jonmaddox/youtub3r
    container_name: youtub3r
    environment:
      - SERVER_HOST=192.168.1.2:8089
    volumes:
      - /path/to/videos:/youtube_videos
